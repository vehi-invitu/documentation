Customer invoices
=================

A customer invoice is a document issued by a company for products and/or services sold to a
customer. It records receivables as they are sent to customers. Customer invoices can include
amounts due for the goods and/or services provided, applicable sales taxes, shipping and handling
fees, and other charges.
Odoo supports multiple invoicing and payment workflows.

   - :doc:`/applications/finance/accounting/customer_invoices/overview`

From draft invoice to profit and loss report, the process involves several steps once the goods (or
services) have been ordered/shipped (or rendered) to a customer, depending on the invoicing policy:

- :ref:`accounting/invoice/creation`
- :ref:`accounting/invoice/confirmation`
- :ref:`accounting/invoice/sending`
- :ref:`accounting/invoice/paymentandreconciliation`
- :ref:`accounting/invoice/followup`
- :ref:`accounting/invoice/reporting`

.. note::
   Odoo :guilabel:`Invoicing` is a standalone app designed to create invoices, send them to
   customers, and manage payments. It also handles flows involving vendor bills. On the other hand,
   the :guilabel:`Accounting` app is a comprehensive accounting solution that allows the same
   actions and includes additional features such as standard financial reports, bank reconciliation,
   budgets, asset management, and more.

.. _accounting/invoice/creation:

Invoice creation
================

Draft invoices can be created directly from documents like sales orders or purchase orders or
manually from the :guilabel:`Customer Invoices` journal in the :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard`.

An invoice must include the required information to enable the customer to pay promptly for their
goods and services. Make sure the following fields are appropriately completed:

- :guilabel:`Customer`: When a customer is selected, Odoo automatically pulls information from the
  customer record like the invoice address,
  :doc:`preferred payment terms <customer_invoices/payment_terms>`,
  :doc:`fiscal positions <taxes/fiscal_positions>`, receivable account, and more onto the invoice.
  To change these values for this specific invoice, edit them directly on the invoice. To change
  them for future invoices, change the values on the contact record.
- :guilabel:`Invoice Date`: If not set manually, this field is automatically set as the current date
  upon confirmation.
- :guilabel:`Due Date` or :doc:`payment terms <customer_invoices/payment_terms>`: To specify when
  the customer has to pay the invoice.
- :guilabel:`Journal`: Is automatically set and can be changed if needed.
- :doc:`Currency <get_started/multi_currency>`
- :guilabel:`Product`
- :guilabel:`Quantity`
- :guilabel:`Price`
- :doc:`Taxes <taxes>` (if applicable)

.. tip::
   To display the total amount of the invoice in words, go to :menuselection:`Accounting -->
   Configuration --> Settings` and activate the :guilabel:`Total amount of invoice in letters`
   option.

The :guilabel:`Journal Items` tab displays the accounting entries created.
Additional invoice information such as the :guilabel:`Customer Reference`, :doc:`Fiscal Positions
<taxes/fiscal_positions>`, :doc:`Incoterms <customer_invoices/incoterms>`, and more can be added or
modified in the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab.

Odoo initially creates invoices in :guilabel:`Draft` status. While they remain unvalidated, draft
invoices have no accounting impact.

   - :doc:`/applications/sales/sales/invoicing/proforma`

.. _accounting/invoice/confirmation:

Invoice confirmation
====================

Click :guilabel:`Confirm` when the document is completed. The document's status changes to
:guilabel:`Posted`, and a journal entry is generated based on the invoice configuration. On
confirmation, Odoo assigns each document a unique number from a defined
:ref:`sequence <accounting/invoice/sequence>`.

.. note::
   - Once confirmed, an invoice can no longer be updated. Click :guilabel:`Reset to draft` if
     changes are needed.
   - If required, invoices and other journal entries can be locked once posted
     using the :ref:`Lock posted entries with hash <data-inalterability/lock>` feature.

.. _accounting/invoice/sending:

Invoice sending
===============

To send the invoice to the customer, click :guilabel:`Send & Print`. A :guilabel:`Configure your
document layout` pop-up window will appear if a :ref:`default invoice layout
<studio/pdf-reports/default-layout>` hasn't been customized. Then, select how to send this invoice
to the customer in the :guilabel:`Send` window.

To send and print multiple invoices, go to the list view and select them. In the :icon:`fa-cog`
:guilabel:`Actions` menu, select the :guilabel:`Send & Print` option. A banner will appear on the
selected invoices to indicate they are part of an ongoing send and print batch. This helps prevent
the process from being triggered manually again, as it may take some time to complete for
exceptionally large batches.

.. _accounting/invoice/paymentandreconciliation:

Payment and reconciliation
==========================

In Odoo, an invoice is considered :guilabel:`Paid` when the associated accounting entry has been
reconciled with a corresponding bank transaction.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`payments`
   - :doc:`bank/reconciliation`

.. _accounting/invoice/followup:

Payment follow-up
=================

Odoo's :doc:`follow-up actions <payments/follow_up>` help companies follow up on customer invoices.
Different actions can be set up to remind customers to pay their outstanding invoices, depending on
how much the customer is overdue. These actions are bundled into follow-up levels that trigger when
an invoice is overdue by a certain number of days. If there are multiple overdue invoices for the
same customer, the actions are performed on the most overdue invoice.

.. _accounting/invoice/reporting:

Reporting
=========

.. _accounting/invoice/partner-reports:

Partner reports
---------------

.. _accounting/invoices/partner-ledger:

Partner Ledger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Partner Ledger` report shows the balance of customers and suppliers. To access it,
go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Ledger`.

.. _accounting/invoices/aging-report:

Aged Receivable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To review outstanding customer invoices and their related due dates, use the
:ref:`Aged Receivable <accounting/reporting/aged-receivable>` report. To access it, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Aged Receivable`.

.. _accounting/invoices/aged-payable:

Aged Payable
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To review outstanding vendor bills and their related due dates, use the
:ref:`Aged Payable <accounting/reporting/aged-payable>` report. To access it, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Aged Payable`.

.. _accounting/invoices/profit-and-loss:

Profit and Loss
---------------

The :ref:`Profit and Loss <accounting/reporting/profit-and-loss>` statement shows details of income
and expenses.

.. _accounting/invoices/balance-sheet:

Balance sheet
-------------

The :ref:`Balance Sheet <accounting/reporting/balance-sheet>` summarizes the company's assets,
liabilities, and equity at a specific time.

.. _accounting/invoice/sequence:

Sequence
========

The sequence that Odoo assigns to each document is a unique number made up of a prefix and a number.
The prefix combines the journal code and the entry date and is used to group entries by period. The
number is unique for each period and is used to identify the entry. The default sequence on customer
invoices is INV/YYYY/number. In some specific cases,
:ref:`resequencing <accounting/invoice/resequencing>` invoices might be necessary.

.. _accounting/invoice/resequencing:

Resequencing
------------

Resequencing is not possible:

- When entries are before a lock date.
- When the sequence leads to a duplicate.
- When the :guilabel:`Invoice Date` doesn't match the date contained in the new sequence number.

  .. example::
     If the sequence is changed to INV/2023/XXXXX for a document with an :guilabel:`Invoice Date` of
     2024.

To change the invoice sequence with the structure INV/YYYY/MM/number, add `/MM` with the number of
the month of the :guilabel:`Invoice date`. Odoo will recognize the "/" term as a month and update
the future invoice sequence appropriately with the month of the :guilabel:`Invoice date`.

  .. example::
     If the invoice date is January, change the sequence to `INV/2024/01/XXXXX`.

In this case, if the :guilabel:`Invoice date` isn't aligned with the sequence number, a
:guilabel:`Validation Error` message appears.

.. note::

   - All sequence changes are logged in the chatter to keep the information.
   - Sequence changes also affect the format of future invoices' sequence.

.. _accounting/invoice/resequencing-one-invoice:

Resequencing one invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To resequence the last confirmed invoice, click :guilabel:`Reset to Draft`, then change the
sequence. The invoice now appears in red on the :guilabel:`Customer Invoices` list.

.. _accounting/invoice/mass-resequencing:

Mass-resequencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Resequence` feature in the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Actions` menu is a technical
feature used to change the sequence of several documents. It can be helpful to resequence invoice
numbers when importing invoices from another invoicing or accounting system, mainly if the reference
originates from the previous software and continuity for the current year must be maintained without
restarting from the beginning.

.. note::
   This feature is only available to users with administrator or advisor access.

Follow these steps to resequence invoice numbers:

#. Activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`.
#. From the :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard`, open the :guilabel:`Customer Invoices` journal.
#. Select the documents that need a new sequence.
#. In the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Actions` menu, click :guilabel:`Resequence`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Ordering` field, choose to

   - :guilabel:`Keep current order`: The order of the numbers remains the same.
   - :guilabel:`Reorder by accounting date`: The number is reordered by accounting date.
#. Set the :guilabel:`First New Sequence`.
#. :guilabel:`Preview Modifications` and click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

The first invoice using the new sequence appears in red in the :guilabel:`Customer Invoices` list.
