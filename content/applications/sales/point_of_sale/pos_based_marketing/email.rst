Email Marketing
===============

In Point of Sale, we use the emails saved in Point of Sale orders for email marketing.

.. note::
    - Basic email marketing can be done without an email marketing app.
    - For more advanced email marketing, you can use an email marketing app to track your campaigns.

Flow of Email Marketing:
========================

-  After creating orders with contact details, select them from the POS orders list view.
-  Then, open the server action menu and click on the :guilabel:`Send Email` option.
